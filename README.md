# Bob Ross Jenkins Plugin

This plugin adds an absolutely delightful feature to Jenkins:
depending if your build succeeds, fails, or is unstable, it will show
a picture of Bob Ross *auto-adapting* (that's right, computer science it is!) to the build result!

Seeing that, already many dozens (yes, *dozens*!) of people have decided to take the
plunge and install this plugin to finally see the light. Why not you?

**In all seriousness though, this is simply the ChuckNorris Jenkins plugin, but completely "reskinned" to represent Bob Ross. 
The way the plugin works is completely the same, just the images, quotes and class and function names are different.**
